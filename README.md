# LiqourPriceAnalysis

1. Introduction

This project presents my attempt of a data collection and analysis set up. 

I chose the wine and liqour industry as an example of the type of data that can be collected and analyzed about different types of alcoholic beverages.  This document presents all the steps I took to collect and analyze data from one of the ecommerce platforms specializing in selling wine and liqour. This project was developed for learning purposes with intent to a better understanding about how certain elements of the web work. I did not use this knowledge in any malicious way.  

2. Website Analysis 

Before I could start collecting information about wine and liqour products I had to analyze the website to see how the responses are built that are sent back when a user makes a request to see some specific product that can be displayed on the website. For this step I used tools called Burp and Postman to analyze requests and responses responsible for getting information about the products sold on the website.
